    """
    Constructs a category model for EWK Z+jets processes using control regions and transfer factors.

    This function:
    - Reads histograms from the input ROOT file.
    - Computes transfer factors by dividing the target signal by control regions.
    - Applies systematic uncertainties (JES/JER, theory, and veto nuisances).
    - Adds bin-by-bin statistical uncertainties.
    - Creates and returns a `Category` object.

    Args:
        category_id (str): Unique identifier for the category.
        category_name (str): Human-readable name for the category.
        input_file (ROOT.TFile): Input ROOT file containing relevant histograms.
        output_file (ROOT.TFile): Output ROOT file for storing processed histograms.
        output_workspace (ROOT.RooWorkspace): Output workspace for RooFit objects.
        diagonalizer: Diagonalizer to pass to `Category`
        year (str): Data-taking year.
        convention (str, optional): Naming convention for transfer factors. Defaults to "BU".

    Returns:
        Category: A `Category` object encapsulating the modeled process.
